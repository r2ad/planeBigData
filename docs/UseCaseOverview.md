## The Summary ##

Big Data systems take in data from many sources, integrate it,
correlate it, and then offer a summary of current information using
a variety of visualization and reporting mechanisms. Although there
are a lot of data sources available, this use-case focuses on
publicly available data from the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA). The data will either be live or captured data which shows
airport locations and near real-time flight information of various
carriers. The real-time aspect provides additional challenges which
likely will yield an interesting design.
